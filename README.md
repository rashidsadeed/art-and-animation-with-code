# art-and-animation-with-code
A creatiev coding project, making designs and animations using javascript. There are 5 designs so far along with some animation output from them. More will be added as soon as I make new designs.

*****To Run the scripts******
in your command line:

# run with 'npx' to make sure you get the local CLI
> npx canvas-sketch-cli <file_name.js>

*****iMPORTANT*******
You need to install some javascript dependancies in order to run these scripts. The dependancies are as follows:

1. nodeJS
3. npm
      """You can download the executable file for your OS from https://nodejs.org/
      The installer will install both npm and nodeJS"""

     in order to check if the packages are installed, go to the terminal and type:
     > node -v
     and..
     > npm -v

     it the output to these commands is a version number then you have the packages installed on your system.
   **NOTE**: the commmands should be run separately
   
5. canvas-sketch

   Canvas sketch is the library the scripts are written with. You have to install this lilbrary separately in the terminal.
   to install canvas sketch:

   #installs canvas sketch locally, so you would have it instlled in the same directory are your files.
   > npm install canvas-sketch-cli
